Shutdown/Start ASM VMs by Cloud Service in parallel
===================================================

            

It shutdowns/starts ASM virtual machines by Cloud Service in parallel.


 

It has two parameters: the service name and the action you want to perform (shutdown (true) or start (false) your VMs).
You have to create a Credential Asset with the name **DefaultAzureCredential** in order to access your account. If you need more information, take a look at this post:https://www.returngis.net/

Hope this helps.



        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
